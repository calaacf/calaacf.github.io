			Research in our lab focuses on the understanding of how the visual
			system works in people with normal vision, as well as in people with
			uncorrectable subnormal vision (visual impairment). Uncorrectable
			sub-normal vision can occur as a result of an eye disease
			(e.g., age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of visual
			impairment in the US for people over the age of 65), or even in the
			absence of an eye disease (amblyopia, or "lazy eye").
 			<br><br>
			In our lab, we combine various non-invasive techniques to study
			vision of people with normal or impaired vision. These techniques
			include standard (e.g., signal detection theory) and more
			contemporary psychophysical methods (e.g., reversed-correlation
			method), retinal imaging using Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope
			combined with psychophysical tasks, and functional magnetic brain
			imaging (fMRI).
			<br><br>
			The ultimate goals of our research program are to understand the
			various limiting factors on visual performance in people with visual
			impairment, and to devise methods, devices or rehabilitative
			strategies to improve the functional vision of these people,
			thereby improving their quality of life.
