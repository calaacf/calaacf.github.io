			<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
			The mission of Asian American Christian Fellowship (AACF) is to
			reach into the university and collegiate community, primarily to
			those who are Asian Pacific Americans, with the life-changing message
			of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

			<h3>Vision</h3>
			We are committed to making disciples by educating and equipping
			students in biblical foundations, Christian disciplines, and the
			development of spiritual gifts in order to prepare them for witness
			and service on the campus, in the local church, in the marketplace,
			and in world missions.<br><br>

			<h3>Statement of Faith</h3>
			Asian American Christian Fellowship (AACF) as the campus ministry division of JEMS, believes:
			<ul>
				<li>That the Bible is God’s Word, written by men divinely and uniquely
					inspired by the Holy Spirit, and that it is the supreme and final
					authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
				<li>In One God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and
					Holy Spirit.
				<li>In Jesus Christ, the world’s only Savior; in His pre-existence,
					virgin birth, sinless life, vicarious death, burial, and bodily
					resurrection and personal return.
				<li>In the Holy Spirit as a Person, indwelling and empowering the
					believer, convicting the unsaved and presenting the claims of Christ.
				<li>That sinful man is lost and can be redeemed only by the death and
					shed blood of Christ upon the cross through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit.
				<li>In the resurrection of the dead, the believer to life everlasting
					and the unbeliever to eternal condemnation.
				<li>That the Church, the Body of Christ, is comprised of all who have
					accepted the redemption provided by Christ.
			</ul>

			<h3>What is JEMS?</h3>
			Since 1950, the <a href="http://www.jems.org/" target="_blank">Japanese
			Evangelical Missionary Society (JEMS)</a> has been
			blessed by God to expand and include many faceted ministries that span
			the globe today. By the nature of its multi-faceted ministry and outreach
			into the world which is becoming increasingly multi and inter-racial, JEMS
			has expanded beyond just the Japanese and Japanese Americans. JEMS
			ministries now includes other Asian Americans. We are being enriched
			and empowered to be more effective for doing the work of evangelism,
			discipleship, teaching the Word, training, equipping, unifying the
			believers and churches.

			JEMS began its campus work in the Fall of 1973 at Cal State Los Angeles.
			By 1977, the name Asian American Christian Fellowship came into being
			for the group at Cal State Long Beach. From a small beginning, this
			ministry has grown to involve several thousand students on a number of
			strategic campuses.
